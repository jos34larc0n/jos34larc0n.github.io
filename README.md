# _About me_
## My interests and hobbies
Some of my main interests and hobbies include **music**, **history**, and **comedy**. I'm a big fan of pop culture in general but I rather to support small independent artists. I enjoy playing the guitar and performing stand-up comedy at open mics in my free time. I also love spending time with my family, going out into nature to hike, or simply enjoying the outdoors.
## Websites I enjoy the most
 
 1. * A really useful website for watching content, which I consider indispensable for any fan of comedy, is [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) . On this platform, you can access premium content from many comedians, podcasters, and other content creators. It's also a great way to support your favorite artists.
 
 2. * A website I really enjoy for discovering new music is [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/). I use it a lot to listen to independent and emerging artists who are different from the mainstream pop artists most people know.
